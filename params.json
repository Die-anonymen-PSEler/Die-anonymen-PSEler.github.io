Well wait no longer. RetroMachines is here to SAVE THE DAY. It’s platform game as well as a puzzle game in beautiful old school graphics. But be warned: DANGER OF ADDICTION!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n```\r\n$ Multiple characters\r\n$ Detailed tutorials\r\n$ 10 handcrafted levels\r\n$ Completely free\r\n```\r\nPeaked your interest? Get it today and start playing!\r\n\r\n### Further Information\r\nThe game was developed as a project at the German University KIT. Its goal is to explain the way of working of the lambda calculus, which is a central system within in theoretical computer science. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the project has resulted in a beautiful game for people of all ages.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank our institute for giving us the chance to publish the game here in the play store.\r\n\r\nBoth comments and reviews are greatly appreciated. This does apply to eulogies as well as constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n## Your RetroFactory-Team\r\n\r\n\r\n**Type: Phone, 7-inch tablet, 10-inch Tablet**\r\n**URL's: IPD: https://www.informatik.kit.edu/257.php**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
